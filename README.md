# Moon Database
Created to store the database, scripts, and pics of custom cards not passed by YGOCC's Quality Control (QC) and Balance Team (BT). The source of this repo is either from the #download_packs channel or from authorized Scripting Team members and other such authorized individuals. 

## Specifics
At the moment, cards in this repo are scripted for Koishipro; however, if you wish to contribute to the database, please join our Discord Server to learn more.

### Contributing
To contribute to the Moon repo, you may either make a Pull Request (PR) adding "your cards".cdb, scripts, and pics that your cards need; OR drop "your cards".zip into the #download_packs channel on our Discord Server.
If you make a PR, we will add your cards to the Cards-non QCD.cdb and arrange everything where it needs to go, and the PR wil be closed. This is to ensure that no one tampers with the database in unforseen ways.
